# Getting Started

This project provides three Docker images for different use cases:

- **Base Image** — A slim runtime image for building your own TYPO3 project images. Available as an all-in-one Nginx variant or a standalone FPM variant for Kubernetes.
- **Demo Image** — A pre-installed TYPO3 ready to start for demos, evaluation, and onboarding.
- **Contrib Image** — A development environment for contributing to the TYPO3 Core.

Start with the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) to get a running TYPO3 in minutes, then explore the image that fits your use case.
